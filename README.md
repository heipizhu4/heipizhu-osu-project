# heipizhu-osu-project
Just a place to put all my MUG maps&amp;charts. Edit &amp;PR if you are interested. Pls don't take them away directly as some of them are still not submitted.
If you download my maps/charts, you'll find lots of them are very experimental. For example, I changed osu into Cytus and you should use touchscreen to play the cryout map
